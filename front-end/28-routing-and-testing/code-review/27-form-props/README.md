# 26: Frontend Tooling & React

## Overview

Create a reddit search engine in react

#### Features

Displays: 
* author
* image if there is an image
* video if there is a video
* blog post link
* ups count

### How To

##### Start react app and refresh actively

```
npm run watch
```

### Bugs

Current Bugs: 

* search button bug -- search button auto searches the default value (which is cats :) ), however you have to click twice for new searches.
* null error handling is missing. if you click twice to search and console.log has an error, the reddit form does not exist.
